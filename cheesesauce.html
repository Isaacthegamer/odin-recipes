    <h1>Nacho Cheese Sauce</h1>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a recipe for nacho cheese sauce. Taco Bell uses processed cheese,
        which allows the cheese to stay liquid. This recipe is for a healthy
        alternative, using natural cheese.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup sharp cheddar spread</li>
        <li>1/2 cup cream cheese</li>
        <li>1 tbsp. butter</li>
        <li>2 tsp. Worchestershire sauce (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Soften the cheddar cheese in the microwave (or over a double boiler).</li>
        <li>Add in the cream cheese and butter. (And Worchestershire sauce, if desired.)</li>
        <li>Continue to heat the mixture while continuing to stir often.</li>
        <li>Once it's warm and melted, it's ready!</li> 
    </ol>
    <p>If you want it to stay melted, you need to keep it warm. I recommend using a double
        boiler, so that it can stay constantly warm, and won't burn.</p>
    <p>Also, I didn't notice a difference when using Worchestershire sauce. However, I
        have included it, since some of you may notice the difference and enjoy it.</p>
