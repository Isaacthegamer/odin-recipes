    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a recipe for how to make refried beans and Mexican rice from scratch.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>For Beans:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>125g dry pinto beans, soaked overnight</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove</li>
        <li>1/2 medium-sized onion</li>

        <li>3/4 cup salsa</li>
        <li>4 cups water</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Put all the ingredients for the rice in a rice cooker and cook it according to your rice cooker's specifications.</li>
        <li>In a pot, bring the beans to a boil and skim the foam.</li>
        <li>Let simmer for 40-50 minutes.</li>
        <li>Chop up the garlic and onion.</li>
        <li>In a separate pan, fry the garlic and onion with a little oil. (Use a little salt if desired.)</li>
        <li>When the onion is transparent, add the garlic and onion to the pot with the beans.</li>
        <li>Stir and simmer for another 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Turn off the heat and smash the beans with a fork or masher.</li>
        <li>Now, you've got homemade refried beans and Mexican rice!</li>
    </ol>
    <p>You can save a lot of time with the beans by also cooking them in a rice cooker. Good luck!</p>
